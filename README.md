Scaling instances with fingers 
-------------------------------
The provided Python script uses the OpenCV library to capture video from a camera and detects hand gestures using the cvzone.HandTrackingModule module. The script interacts with Amazon Web Services (AWS) using the Boto3 library to manage EC2 instances. It can launch and terminate EC2 instances based on hand gestures detected by the camera.

The LaunchOS() function creates a new t2.micro instance with a specific Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and adds it to a target group in an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) on AWS. The TerminateOS() function terminates the last launched instance and removes it from the ELB target group. Hand gestures are used to trigger these actions: a certain finger configuration launches an instance, while a different configuration terminates it.

It's important to note that the script requires the cvzone and boto3 libraries, as well as appropriate AWS credentials, to function correctly.****
